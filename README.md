## Code Structure of FedGraphNN
<!-- Note: The code of FedGraphNN only uses `FedML/fedml_core` and `FedML/fedml_api`.
In near future, once FedML is stable, we will release it as a python package. 
At that time, we can install FedML package with pip or conda, without the need to use Git submodule. -->

- `FedML`: A soft repository link generated using `git submodule add https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML`.

- `data`: Provide data downloading scripts and store the downloaded datasets.
Note that in `FedML/data`, there also exists datasets for research, but these datasets are used for evaluating federated optimizers (e.g., FedAvg) and platforms. FedGraphNN supports more advanced datasets and models for federated training of graph neural networks. Currently, we have molecular machine learning datasets. 

- `data_preprocessing`: Domain-specific PyTorch Data loaders for centralized and distributed training. 

- `model`: GNN models.

- `trainer`: please define your own `trainer.py` by inheriting the base class in `FedML/fedml-core/trainer/fedavg_trainer.py`.
Some tasks can share the same trainer.

- `experiments/distributed`: 
1. `experiments` is the entry point for training. It contains experiments in different platforms. We start from `distributed`.
1. Every experiment integrates FOUR building blocks `FedML` (federated optimizers), `data_preprocessing`, `model`, `trainer`.
3. To develop new experiments, please refer the code at `experiments/distributed/text-classification`.

- `experiments/centralized`: 
1. please provide centralized training script in this directory. 
2. This is used to get the reference model accuracy for FL. 
3. You may need to accelerate your training through distributed training on multi-GPUs and multi-machines. Please refer the code at `experiments/centralized/DDP_demo`.
